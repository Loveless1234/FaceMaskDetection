# FaceMaskDetection


## 😇 Motivation

In the present scenario due to Covid-19, there is no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety. Also, the absence of large datasets of ‘with_mask’ images has made this task more cumbersome and challenging.

## 📁 What I did??
 - This is already prepared which I given to you. But behind of these I created my own image dataset(4200 images), then did Image Labelling,Model configuration.
 - After that I used SSDlite_Mobilenet_v2 model and I trained it around 10 hours.
 - Model is trained os 12GB NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU
 - So guys I given lots of efforts to complete this project. So please Star🌟 my repository and follow me.

## ⚠️ Tech/framework used
 - Tensorflow
 - OpenCV
 - SSDlite Mobilenet V2

## ⭐ Features
Our face mask detector didn't uses any morphed masked images dataset. The model is accurate, and since we used the MobileNetV2 architecture, it’s also computationally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.).

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.
