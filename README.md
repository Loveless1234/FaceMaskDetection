## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of the Project

As Social Distancing is only tool to prevent COVID-19 wearing face masks is compulsory. To monitor whether a person is wearing mask or not. I came up with a solution using computer vision. Here I used ssdlite_mobilenet_v2 object detection model to detect where a person is wearing mask or not .Here i used face mask detection dataset from kaggle.
