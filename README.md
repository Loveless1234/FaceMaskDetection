# FaceMaskDetection


## üòá Motivation

In the present scenario due to Covid-19, there is no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for airports, hospitals, Offices & Working Spaces, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety. Also, the absence of large datasets of ‚Äòwith_mask‚Äô images has made this task more cumbersome and challenging.

## üìÅ What I did??
 - This is already prepared which I given to you. But behind of these I created my own image dataset(4200 images), then did Image Labelling,Model configuration.
 - After that I used SSDlite_Mobilenet_v2 model.
 - Model is trained on 12GB NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU
 - So guys I given lots of efforts to complete this project. So please Starüåü my repository and follow me.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Tech/framework used
 - Tensorflow
 - OpenCV
 - SSDlite Mobilenet V2

## ‚≠ê Features
Our face mask detector didn't uses any morphed masked images dataset. The model is accurate, and since we used the MobileNetV2 architecture, it‚Äôs also computationally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.).

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.

## Use Cases

Here are a few use cases where this mask detection technology could be leveraged.

### Airports
The Face Mask Detection System could be used at airports to detect travelers without masks. Face data of travelers can be captured in the system at the entrance. If a traveler is found to be without a face mask, their picture is sent to the airport authorities so that they could take quick action.

### Hospitals
Using Face Mask Detector System, Hospitals can monitor if quarantined people required to wear a mask are doing so or not. The same holds good for monitoring staff on duty too.


### Offices & Working Spaces
The Face Mask Detection System can be used at office premises to ascertain if employees are maintaining safety standards at work. It monitors employees without masks and sends them a reminder to wear a mask.


### Government
To limit the spread of coronavirus, the police could deploy the face mask detector on its fleet of surveillance cameras to enforce the compulsory wearing of face masks in public places.
